# Data Collection and Analysis of Music Upload Patterns on SoundCloud
*Describe the purpose of this project* 

## Motivation

* We were interested in understanding how new music producers who are not signed to a label approach
SoundCloud, a free and accessible platform, to gain followers and build their audience. In the evolving music
industry, there are multiple pathways to becoming popular, and SoundCloud serves as a critical space where
independent artists can distribute their work without traditional gatekeepers. This study aims to explore the
strategies these artists use, how frequently they upload music, and whether their activity correlates with key
popularity metrics such as the number of plays and followers.
Multiple articles have examined how the new music industry is changing, but few have focused specifically on
SoundCloud. Studies such as Dunham (2022), Hubbles et al. (2017), and Maturo (2015) have explored various
aspects of digital music distribution. Prior work, such as Hubbles et al. (2017), focused on how to become famous,
particularly through social engagement and audience interaction, but did not address upload frequency. Despite
the growing body of research on digital platforms, no studies have specifically investigated the frequency of
uploads on SoundCloud and its impact on artist success. This study fills that gap by providing an analysis of
SoundCloud-specific upload behaviors.
By collecting and analyzing this data, we can contribute to a broader understanding of digital music distribution,
offering insights that are valuable to both researchers studying music industry trends and artists seeking optimal
strategies for audience engagement. The dataset generated through this research will help address the knowledge
gap regarding independent music distribution patterns and will provide actionable intelligence for industry
stakeholders, such as record labels, marketing agencies, and data-driven music platforms.

## Data
To obtain data on SoundCloud music uploads, we considered multiple methods of data collection.
Initially, web scraping appeared to be a viable option due to its ability to extract large amounts of unstructured
data from web pages. Web scraping would have allowed us to access publicly available artist profiles and track
metadata without API request limitations. However, after examining the SoundCloud website, we identified that
an official API was available. We contacted the company and obtained permission to use the SoundCloud for
Developers API, which grants access to all the relevant metadata in a structured format. Given the legal and
ethical concerns of web scraping and the comprehensive data access provided by the API, we opted for an
API-based approach.
